## Overview

This is our first post for the Fall 2024 Software Engineering class about the [Software Engineering at Google book](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book)! This article will relate our work with [Gatorgrade](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrade) with the technical skills from the [Introduction to Software Testing](https://www.fuzzingbook.org/html/Intro_Testing.html) section of [The Fuzzing Book](https://www.fuzzingbook.org/).

While developing Gatorgrade and it's features we will be using an automatic method to check our code as well as develop a way to "grade" others automatically. Software testing is key to our work so it is important to understand the basics of testing and why we do it.

## Summary

### What is software testing?
Software testing is the process of evaluating and verifying that a software application or system meets specified requirements. It involves executing code in a controlled environment to check for errors, gaps, or missing requirements. So, why is it important?

* Helps identify bugs, errors, or issues in the software before it is released to users. 
* Ensures that the program behaves as expected.
* Provides feedback that helps developers improve the software iteratively, making it better with every update.

### Simple Testing in Python

To perform effective testing in Python, you need to understand three fundamental things:

* Python uses indentation for defining code blocks.
* Python is dynamically typed, meaning variables do not have fixed types.
* Python borrows syntax from other common languages, making it easier to grasp for those familiar with programming.

### Automating Tests

Automated tests can check if results are as expected using assertions. For example, assert statements take a condition and raise an exception if the condition is false This helps automate the validation process and identify issues early on. A few examples for effective automating tests include:

* Use assertions to automatically check if results are as expected.
* Handle floating-point precision issues with a small epsilon value.
* Write reusable test functions to simplify and streamline testing.

### Limitations of testing

Testing, no matter how thorough, can't guarantee that the software is 100% free of errors. It can, however, significantly reduce the likelihood of issues by catching them early in the development process. Testing provides confidence that the program works as intended but does not promise a perfect program.

## Quiz Time 

### 1. Which of these is the prefered way to test code? Why?

**Bonus points** How many things can you list to improve in both test cases?

```python 
# OPTION A 

def test_the_function(
    testing_dir,
):
    generate_config(["writing"], str(testing_dir))
    gatorgrade_yml = testing_dir / "gatorgrade.yml"
    if "src/test.py" not ingatorgrade_yml.open().read():
        print("Yay it worked!")
    else: 
        print("sad days")
    if "writing/reflection.md" in gatorgrade_yml.open().read():
        print("(◠‿◠)")

```

```python
# OPTION B

def test_generate_config_creates_gatorgrade_yml_without_dir_not_in_user_input(
    testing_dir,
):
    """Test to see if input does not match directory"""
    # When generate_config is called
    generate_config(["writing"], str(testing_dir))
    # Then gatorgrade.yml is created
    gatorgrade_yml = testing_dir / "gatorgrade.yml"
    assert "src/test.py" not in gatorgrade_yml.open().read()
    assert "writing/reflection.md" in gatorgrade_yml.open().read()

```

**Answer: B!**  
The second test case is better than the first one because it is a lot more descriptive and automatically passes or fails through the use of `assert` statements. There are things to be improved in both cases but in general the more understandable the test case the better. It is important that future contributors know what the test cases are actually doing through comments and docstrings. Assert statements are also important for automatic testing so that the checks do not need to be done manually.

The correct code is from [Gatorgrade](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrade)! So exciting!

### 2. Why do we want to put the `if key not in targeted_paths_string:` in the following code?

```python
...
    targeted_paths_string = " ".join(targeted_paths)
    for key in target_path_list:
        if key not in targeted_paths_string:
            typer.secho(
                f"WARNING \u26A0: '{key}' file path is not FOUND!"
                f"\nAll file paths except '{key}' are successfully"
                " generated in the 'gatorgrade.yml' file",
                fg=typer.colors.YELLOW,
            )
            return targeted_paths

    # If all the files exist in the root directory, print out a success message
    if targeted_paths:
        typer.secho(
            "SUCCESS \U0001F525: All the file paths were"
            " successfully generated in the 'gatorgrade.yml' file!",
            fg=typer.colors.GREEN,
        )

    return targeted_paths
```

**Answer!**  
That `if` statement helps to catch an error with the files! If it isnt found the user will get a warning message to say that there was an issue. Warning messages are important because they give more detailed information on why something went wrong with the code. While developing code keep in mind these cases where something can go wrong and make error messages that will go towards fixing those issues. Or catch specific instances where an input might not work. For example a divide by 0 error can be prevented by adding an `if` statement that catches if 0 was the input.

This code is from [Gatorgrade](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrade) in the `generate.py` file! So exciting!

### 3. What deoes this error message mean?

**Bonus points** How could you prevent this error from happening as the software engineer?

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/var/folders/n2/xd9445p97rb3xh7m1dfx8_4h0006ts/T/ipykernel_56828/1336991207.py", line 2, in <cell line: 1>
    sqrt_program("xyzzy")
  File "/var/folders/n2/xd9445p97rb3xh7m1dfx8_4h0006ts/T/ipykernel_56828/3211514011.py", line 2, in sqrt_program
    x = int(arg)
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'xyzzy' (expected)
```

**Answer!** 

That error means that an invalid input was given to the program! It was expecting an integer but recieved `xyzzy` which is a string. This caused a `ValueError`. These errors can be prevented by writing code that checks the input to see if it is valid or not (sanitize it). You can do this in a variety of ways such as `if` statements or assertions. Use type annotations as well to avoid confusion between collaborators. You can also use `try-except` cases to handle code and not crash the program if there is an issue. Writing custom error messages can also be helpful to future users because they can be more description of where the problem stems from.

## Reflection

One key takeaway is how testing not only helps catch bugs but also provides a structured way to think about code quality and reliability. As we move forward in our software engineering journeys, the importance of integrating testing into our workflow early and often is clear.


## Action Items

Regardless of the task you are assigned, be thoughtful of those writing the tests and making your program as readable as possible. We will be able to write better test cases if we understand the code as much as possible. Software testing will be extremely beneficial to catching bugs and other issues with our code throughout the semester so make sure to test after a change has been made!
