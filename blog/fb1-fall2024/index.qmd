## Overview

### What is software testing?
Software testing is the process of evaluating and verifying that a software application or system meets specified requirements. It involves executing code in a controlled environment to check for errors, gaps, or missing requirements. So, why is it important?

* Helps identify bugs, errors, or issues in the software before it is released to users. 
* Ensures that the program behaves as expected.
* Provides feedback that helps developers improve the software iteratively, making it better with every update.

### Simple Testing in Python

To perform effective testing in Python, you need to understand three fundamental things:

* Python uses indentation for defining code blocks.
* Python is dynamically typed, meaning variables do not have fixed types.
* Python borrows syntax from other common languages, making it easier to grasp for those familiar with programming.
