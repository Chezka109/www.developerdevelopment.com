## Overview

### What is software testing?
Software testing is the process of evaluating and verifying that a software application or system meets specified requirements. It involves executing code in a controlled environment to check for errors, gaps, or missing requirements. Why is it important?

* Helps identify bugs, errors, or issues in the software before it is released to users. 
* Ensures that the application behaves as expected in different scenarios.
* Provides feedback that helps developers improve the software iteratively, making it better with every update.
