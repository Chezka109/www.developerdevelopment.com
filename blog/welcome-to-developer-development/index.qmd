The Developer Development [blog](../index.qmd) features three main types of articles:

- **Professional Development Executive Summaries** furnish the responses from
learners who recently read a chapter in [Software Engineering at
Google](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book) book.

- **Technical Development Executive Summaries** furnish the responses from
learners who recently read a chapter in [Fuzzing
Book](https://www.fuzzingbook.org/) or [Debugging
Book](https://www.debuggingbook.org/).

- **Incident Reports** describe what the team of developing developers learned
after making mistakes when honing their professional and technical skills and
implementing one of two long-term, open-source software tools.
